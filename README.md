 Hotel Booking Demand Analysis

Predicting hotel reservation cancellations using booking behavior, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis.

 Project Overview

Hotel cancellations can lead to lost revenue and operational inefficiencies. This project explores booking data from a city hotel and a resort hotel to uncover patterns behind cancellations and build a predictive model to anticipate them.

 Dataset

Source: [Hotel Booking Demand Datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) by Antonio, Almeida, and Nunes
- **Cleaned by**: Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for #TidyTuesday (Feb 11, 2020)
- **Timeframe**: July 2015 ‚Äì August 2017
- **Rows**: 119,210 bookings
- **Columns**: 53 features including lead time, room type, guest count, booking channel, and cancellation status

 Key Questions

- Which family sizes are most likely to cancel?
- How do cancellation rates vary by season?
- Are longer lead times associated with higher cancellation risk?
- Can we build a model to predict cancellations?

 Tools Used

- Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub
