 Hotel Booking Demand Analysis

Predicting hotel reservation cancellations using booking behavior, feature engineering, and exploratory analysis.

 Project Overview

Hotel cancellations can lead to lost revenue and operational inefficiencies. 
This project explores booking data from a city hotel and a resort hotel to 
uncover patterns behind cancellations and build a predictive model to anticipate them.

 My Role: 
 I led all data engineering, exploratory analysis, and dashboard design, 
from raw CSV to interactive Power BI visuals, using Python, VS Code, and Git for version control.

 Dataset

Source: [Hotel Booking Demand Datasets](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340918315191) by Antonio, Almeida, and Nunes
- **Cleaned by**: Thomas Mock and Antoine Bichat for #TidyTuesday (Feb 11, 2020)
- **Timeframe**: July 2015 – August 2017
- **Rows**: 119,210 bookings
- **Columns**: 53 features including lead time, room type, guest count, booking channel, and cancellation status

 Key Questions

- Which family sizes are most likely to cancel?
- How do cancellation rates vary by season?
- Are longer lead times associated with higher cancellation risk?
- Can we build a model to predict cancellations?

 Tools Used

- Python (pandas, seaborn, scikit-learn)
- Jupyter Notebooks
- VS Code
- Git & GitHub

📁 Project Structure
🚀 Next Steps

- ✅ Load and explore dataset → Identified missing values and one-hot encoded categories
- ✅ Engineer features → Created family size, stay length, and booking window variables
- ⏳ Build and evaluate predictive model → Forecast cancellations with >80% accuracy
- ⏳ Summarize findings → Highlight actionable recommendations for revenue teams

The approach and visuals in this project can be adapted to any hospitality context where reducing cancellations drives measurable ROI.
